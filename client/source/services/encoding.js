/**
 * A function that takes an object and returns it encoded as a JSON Buffer.
 * Should work identically to the processor version. Feel free to copy and
 * paste any work you did there.
 *
 * Example:
 *   const encoded = encode({ hello: 'world', foo: 'bar' })
 *   console.log(encoded)  // <Buffer 7b 22 66 6f 6f 22 3a 22 62 61 72 22 ... >
 *   console.log(encoded.toString())  // '{"foo":"bar","hello":"world"}'
 *
 * Hint:
 *   Remember that all transactions and blocks must be generated
 *   deterministically! JSON is convenient, but you will need to sort
 *   your object's keys or random transactions may fail.
